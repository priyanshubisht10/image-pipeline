# Image-Pipeline
This project is a React-based application that allows users to upload an image, draw over it to create a mask, and export both the original image and the mask. Users can adjust the brush size and draw on the image, with the mask displayed on a black-and-white canvas. The application supports exporting the mask and preview images as PNG files. Built using the HTML5 Canvas API, it offers interactive drawing, canvas clearing, and side-by-side image comparison, making it a simple yet powerful tool for generating image masks.
